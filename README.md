# Trim Pluses

**Trim Pluses** is a lightweight Visual Studio Code extension that removes leading plus signs (`+`) from the beginning of each line in the selected text, or the entire document if no selection is made. It's particularly useful for cleaning up diff outputs, versioned changelogs, or other documents with leading markers.
